Changelog for ModCheck
Updating ModCheck will not break existing xml files.

v1.7
- Rewritten the log writing system to give better control/more features to patch writers
- Rewritten error messages to make it easier to find the error
- Changed profiling output to write total time on top, making it appear in the log overview
- All PatchOperation names can now be used starting with both upper and lower case (fixes naming inconsistency)
- Added new mode to LoadOrder. It can now use first and last strings instead of the old approach (which still works)
- Added Sequence operation, which does the same as the vanilla operation, but with ModCheck specific options
- Added logic operations AND, OR, IfElse, Loop and Once
- Added warning/error if outdated versions of ModCheck are being loaded (risk of new vs old conflicts)
- Added a preview logo (thanks to larSyn for drawing it)
- Added support for ModSync RW
- Fix: profiling now displays correct time if the hardware has a high precision timer
- Removed the need to include yourMod and modName unless they are actually used

v1.6
- Added FindFile to greatly speed up patch files
- Added patch operation profiling (with verbose logging only)

v1.5
- Added ModSync.xml
- Added PatchOperation isModSyncVersion

v1.4
- Fixed issue where cache failed to update as needed

v1.3
- Fix: checks are now only executed once (massive performance boost)
- Fix: writing to the log will now always only write one line and never repeat the same many times

v1.2
- Added custom message support (like logging: My mod detected modX and will patch itself accordingly)
- Added ability to detect another mod by more than one name (like name v1.3 and name v1.4)
- Major code redesign to greatly reduce the risk of bugs when adding new features

Note: stopped releasing for A17 due to the release of stable B18.
If you want to use A17, copying the v1.2 DLL will likely work, but it's untested.

v1.1
- Converted to mod layout for steam release

v1.0
- Initial release
