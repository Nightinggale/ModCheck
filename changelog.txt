Changelog for ModCheck
Updating ModCheck will not break existing xml files unless stated otherwise.

v1.8.1
- Fixed compatibility issue with updated Rimworld. Profiling works again.
- Updated version URL for Fluffy's Mod Manager

v1.8 (RW 1.0)
Update to about only. The DLL file will not even have to be updated.

- RimWorld 1.0 support
- Added support for Fluffy's Mod Manager

v1.8
This is a significant update from a coding point of view. B19 vanilla changed completely regarding patching.
While the code is significantly better, all Harmony calls from ModCheck had to be redesigned and rewritten.

- Added B19 support
- Added Search operation to speed up patching when the same object is patched multiple times in a row
- Added Move operation to control cases where order matters (like order of building buttons)
- Patch profiling now measures the time more accurately (less rounding errors)

XML BREAKING ALERT!!!
Removed FindFile operation (vanilla rewrite renders it both obsolete and impossible to implement)
Any xml file with FindFile will need updating.

v1.7
- Speedboost: cached mod indexes for massive speed boost of some ModCheck internals
- Rewritten the log writing system to give better control/more features to patch writers
- Rewritten error messages to make it easier to find the error
- Changed profiling output. Total on top, one entry for each mod
- All PatchOperation names can now be used starting with both upper and lower case (fixes naming inconsistency)
- Added new mode to LoadOrder. It can now use first and last strings instead of the old approach (which still works)
- Added Sequence operation, which does the same as the vanilla operation, but with ModCheck specific options
- Added logic operations AND, OR, IfElse, Loop and Once
- Added warning/error if outdated versions of ModCheck are being loaded (risk of new vs old conflicts)
- Added a preview logo (thanks to larSyn for drawing it)
- Added support for ModSync RW
- Fix: profiling now displays correct time if the hardware has a high precision timer
- Fix: profiling will no longer cut off the output if you have a lot of patches
- Removed the need to include yourMod and modName unless they are actually used

v1.6
- Added FindFile to greatly speed up patch files
- Added patch operation profiling (with verbose logging only)

v1.5
- Added ModSync.xml
- Added PatchOperation isModSyncVersion

v1.4
- Fixed issue where cache failed to update as needed

v1.3
- Fix: checks are now only executed once (massive performance boost)
- Fix: writing to the log will now always only write one line and never repeat the same many times

v1.2
- Added custom message support (like logging: My mod detected modX and will patch itself accordingly)
- Added ability to detect another mod by more than one name (like name v1.3 and name v1.4)
- Major code redesign to greatly reduce the risk of bugs when adding new features

Note: stopped releasing for A17 due to the release of stable B18.
If you want to use A17, copying the v1.2 DLL will likely work, but it's untested.

v1.1
- Converted to mod layout for steam release

v1.0
- Initial release
