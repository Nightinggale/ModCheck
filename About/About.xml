	<description>Adds the ability to create errors if required mods aren't loaded or incompatible mods are loaded as well as adding patch conditions related to other mods.
	
For players:
Load this before Core
Technically load order often doesn't matter, but in some cases it's good to have before any mod using ModCheck and nothing bad will happen from loading before Core.

For modders:
Follow the link for a guide on how to make your mod use the included features.</description>
